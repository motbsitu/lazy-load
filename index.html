    <p>I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. They were just sucked into space. I am your worst nightmare! Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Talk about going nowhere fast. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. How long can two people talk about nothing? Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence.</p>
